                About Budget Blues
            </h2>
            <p>
                Everything seems to get more expensive with each day. As prices rise, many of us are tightening our belts&#59; so are institutions. Universities across the nation are struggling to cope with inflated costs and declining enrollment. And so the list of institutions forced to close, merge or dramatically cut back budgets grows longer. The New School is in a budget crisis of its own. In spring of 2023, university leadership announced a projected $85.5 million budget deficit over the next 5 years. That estimate recently jumped to $200 million. In an effort to address the shortfall, the university has made concerted efforts to repair the financial stability of The New School. Budget Blues follows the university&apos;s actions to remedy the deficit, and their impact on the TNS community.
