                About the Universities<br>Budget Blues
            </h2>
            <p>
                As universities across the nation are struggling to cope with inflated costs and declining enrollment and retention, the list of institutions forced to close, merge or dramatically cut back costs is long and growing. Last year The New School joined that list. In spring of 2023, university leadership announced a projected $85.5 million budget deficit over the next 5 years, a number that jumped to a $200 million at the beginning of this year. In an effort to address the shortfall, the university has made concerted efforts to repair the financial stability of The New School. Budget Blues is dedicated to covering the university&#39;s actions to remedy the deficit, and their impact on the TNS community.
